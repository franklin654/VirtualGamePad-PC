## Generating Documentation

This project uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate documentation.  
If Doxygen is available on your system,  
You can generate the documentation by running the following command:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This repository has automated workflow via Github Actions.  
Documentation is auto-generated and deployed to [Github Pages](https://kitswas.github.io/CPP-project-template/).  
Disable Actions on your own copy or delete the [workflows](./.github/workflows) folder if you do not want to be billed. This is **not my responsiblity.**
